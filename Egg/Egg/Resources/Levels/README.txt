In order to make a level:

1. Make individual screens in level maker (P+O+G in main menu of game)
2. Make a folder called level# (# = number of the level, ex: level4)
3. Make folders inside level# called startScreen and endScreen
4. Rename screens to integer based on 2D array
	Ex: top left screen of a 3x3 level is 00 bottom right is 22
		bottom left is 20, top right is 02

Visual aid for step 4:

00 01 02
10 11 12
20 21 22

5. Place your starting screen (beginning of the level) in the startScreen folder
6. Place your ending screen (end of the level) in the endScreen folder
7. Place all other screens in level# folder (not inside any of the two above folders)

If you did it right, your screens should be stapled correctly into a cohesive level!
